# Sentence-Grammar-Corrector
It's a python based simple web application designed
for those Who want to correct the grammar in their
Written sentence. 
How to run this app(I am talking in terms of
Windows OS having nvidia Geforce GPU):
1) Download Cuda 11.1
2) Download pytorch(LTS version) 
3) Download visual Studio especially inside it tick
   C++ there.
4) Install gramformer
5) Install happytransformer
6) Install gradio

After performing all the steps I agree they are 
Very tedious plus large in size but result is
quite good(as web apps like grammarly charge 
Money for these things but now you will have
Your own web app like that and you can use it for 
Free) simply take reference from my code and run
the file
